# Twitcher
Desktop app to load currently online streams you follow, and start one using VLC.
<p/>WPF application that uses the [Twitch Kraken APIs](github.com/justintv/Twitch-API) /follows and /stream endpoint to implement a desktop streamlist, that lets users watch streams without the browser interaction.
<p/>This is just a hobby project, born from the frustration with Flash's resource hungry behaviour.
